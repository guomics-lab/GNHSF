auc_curves: Contains AUC (Area Under the Curve) plots generated from both internal and external test sets.
boxplot: Contains boxplot visualizations that summarize the distribution of scores across different datasets or conditions.
figure_R: This directory contains the R scripts used for generating the figures in the research paper
output: This directory holds all output files produced by the model during its execution. It includes predictions, calculated metrics, and other generated data.
plot_auc_boxplots.py: A script used to generate boxplots illustrating the distribution of AUC scores across 20 random seeds.
plot_pr_auc_boxplots.py: A script designed to create boxplots that depict the distribution of PR-AUC (Precision-Recall Area Under the Curve) scores across 20 random seeds.
plot_auc_pr_curves.py: A script for plotting AUC and PR curves based on the results from internal and external test sets.
